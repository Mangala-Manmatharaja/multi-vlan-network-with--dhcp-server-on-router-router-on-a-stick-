# multi-vlan-network-with--dhcp-server-on-router-router-on-a-stick-
This project demonstrates the configuration of a multi-VLAN network using a router-on-a-stick setup in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network utilizes VLANs to segment traffic  includes a DHCP server hosted on the router to dynamically allocate IP addresses to devices within each VLAN.
This basic setup ensures VLAN-based traffic segmentation, dynamic IP allocation, and seamless inter-VLAN communication through the router's subinterfaces.
